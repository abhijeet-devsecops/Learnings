##  4. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

LutherCorp is adopting ZTA to replace perimeter-based security with identity- and context-aware controls.

### ZTA Pillars & Implementation

| Pillar     | Action                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity   | Enforce MFA, conditional access, identity federation |
| Network    | Micro-segmentation of internal and cloud networks    |
| Workloads  | Container scanning, runtime protection               |
| Analytics  | SIEM + UEBA for anomaly detection                    |
| Visibility | Centralized logging, real-time alerting              |
|  Policy    | Least privilege, just-in-time access                 |
